        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img id="headshot" src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Photo of Arshdeep Singh Sahota">
        <p>Hello! My name is Arshdeep Singh Sahota. I was born in <em>New Delhi, India</em> in 2006 and moved to
            <strong>Canada</strong> in 2013. In 2018, I proudly became a Canadian citizen.
        </p>
        <p>I've had some unique experiences, including being featured twice in the <mark>Brockville Recorder and
                Times</mark> newspaper — once for a summer camp and once for a culture sharing event. I also earned a
            worldwide <strong>first place podium finish</strong> in one of the historical events in <em>Dirt Rally
                2</em>, one of my favorite rally games, competing against players from across the globe.</p>

            "The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be
            readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter — for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation
            for those who are to come, and point the way."
            - Nikola Tesla

            <h3>My School Background</h3>

                I completed my elementary education at <strong>Westminster Public School</strong> in Brockville,
                Ontario, Canada,
                followed by high school at <strong>TISS (Thousand Islands Secondary School)</strong>, also in
                Brockville, Ontario, where I
                completed a <abbr title="Specialist High Skills Major">SHSM</abbr> in Engineering.
                Currently, I am enrolled in the <abbr
                    title="Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science">CET-CS</abbr> program at Algonquin
                College.
