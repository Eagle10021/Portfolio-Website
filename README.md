# Portfolio Website: Arshdeep Singh Sahota

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, a project completed as part of my studies at **Algonquin College** for the **Computer Engineering Technology: Computing Science** program.

The site is designed to be a **simple, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing single-page application** that showcases my academic journey, work experience, hobbies, and technical skills.
